### Information Architecture
We want the menu navigation to go like Home, About, Our Menu and Contact / Location,  
This is the most effective way of displaying it as we are telling a story as we go along from right to left in the menu.

We want the Menu to be displayed completely on the site to make it easier for customers, 
also will be displayed is all new Coffees at the very top.

We want Contact details, and location displayed on the same page, insuring customers don’t 
have to click around the site searching for information.

The preference for the home page is attracting customers to view the menu 
whilst also displaying any new coffee that has become available.

Display Opening Hours.

Give customers a back story on the brand new Coffee Shop and where our fresh Coffee beans come from.
