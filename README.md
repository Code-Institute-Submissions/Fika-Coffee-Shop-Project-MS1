and from there using our google maps location, easily find the place.

### Features
* Displaying new products that become available
* Display Company's opening hours
* Viewing the Menu
* The location will be available.

* Display Active Social media icons

### Information Architecture
We want the menu navigation to go like Home, About, Our Menu and Contact / Location,  
This is the most effective way of displaying it as we are telling a story as we go along from right to left in the menu.

We want the Menu to be displayed completely on the site to make it easier for customers, 
also will be displayed is all new Coffees at the very top.

We want Contact details, and location displayed on the same page, insuring customers don’t 
have to click around the site searching for information.

The preference for the home page is attracting customers to view the menu 
whilst also displaying any new coffee that has become available.

Display Opening Hours.

Give customers a back story on the brand new Coffee Shop and where our fresh Coffee beans come from.

## Testing


### Bugs Discovered

* Problem1 - I was unable to add a background video with a text overlay.
```
Banner with Video wasnt working
<div class=" section">
    <div class="video-container">
        <video autoplay muted>
            <source src="videos/coffee_bean6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video> Help From W3school on video

        <div class="header-text">
            <section class="text-center header-text">
                <h1 class="title">FALL IN LOVE</h1>
                <h2 class="second-text">WITH THE TASTE OF OUR FRESH ROASTED COFFEE</h2>
                <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">VIEW FULL MENU</button>
            </section>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
* Problem1 SOLVED - I eventaully came to the idea of converting the video into a lower res and cropped gif where I used it as a background image which worked out better as it lowered the size of the file.
```
    <div class="container-fluid img-container bg-opacity">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <section class="text-center header-text">
                    <h1 class="title">FALL IN LOVE</h1>
                    <h2 class="second-text">WITH THE TASTE OF OUR FRESH ROASTED COFFEE</h2>
                    <a class="btn btn-outline-primary" href="ourmenu.html" role="button">VIEW FULL MENU</a>
                    
                </section>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    .img-container {
